# Staff_Inviligilation-Allotment
<br>
The objective of a staff invigilation allotment system is to efficiently assign invigilators (staff members responsible for overseeing examinations) to examination sessions in an educational institution. The system aims to streamline the process of invigilator allocation by automating the assignment process based on various criteria such as availability, qualifications, experience, and workload distribution.
